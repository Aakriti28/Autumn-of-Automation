# Autumn-of-Automation
Submissions for the assignments for the training program

### Python
The [`practice.ipynb`](./Python/Practice.ipynb) file includes all the four assignments.

### OpenCV
The [`practice.ipynb`](./OpenCV/practice.ipynb) file includes all the five assignments and rest of the files in folder comprise the data used.

### ML
The [`practice.ipynb`](./ML/practice.ipynb) file includes the rendered notebook of advanced assignment written using pytorch. (Different models have been trained for different attributes and since emotion recognition was a bit more difficult than the other two, it is trained for an additional 50 epochs and has a different model architecture than the rest.)
